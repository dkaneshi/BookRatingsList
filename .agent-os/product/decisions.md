## 2025-08-02: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

BookList will be positioned as a privacy-first book tracking and community discovery platform, differentiating from existing solutions through granular privacy controls and modern technical architecture.

### Context

The book tracking market is dominated by platforms like Goodreads, but users express concerns about data privacy, platform lock-in, and limited control over sharing preferences. There's an opportunity to create a more user-centric solution.

### Rationale

- Privacy-first approach addresses growing user concerns about data ownership
- Modern tech stack (Laravel 12, Livewire 3) provides better performance and developer experience
- Self-hosting option gives users complete control over their data

## 2025-08-02: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Laravel 12 with Livewire 3 and Flux UI Pro as the primary technology stack, with SQLite as the database.

### Context

Need to select a technology stack that enables rapid development while providing modern user experience and easy deployment options.

### Rationale

- Laravel 12 provides mature, well-documented framework with excellent ecosystem
- Livewire 3 enables reactive UI without complex JavaScript frameworks
- Flux UI Pro offers professional components and consistent design system
- SQLite reduces deployment complexity and hosting requirements

## 2025-08-02: Author Model Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement authors as a separate model with many-to-many relationships to books, rather than storing author names as simple text fields.

### Context

Current implementation stores authors as text fields within the book model, which creates data duplication and limits future functionality for author-based features.

### Rationale

- Enables proper author management and deduplication
- Supports books with multiple authors correctly
- Allows for future author-centric features (author pages, author following)
- Improves data integrity and search capabilities

## 2025-08-02: Privacy Control Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement granular privacy controls at the individual rating level, allowing users to set public, friends-only, or private visibility for each book rating.

### Context

Users want to share some book ratings publicly while keeping others private. Existing platforms typically use all-or-nothing privacy approaches.

### Rationale

- Provides users maximum control over their data sharing
- Enables selective participation in community features
- Differentiates from competitors with more flexible privacy model
- Supports both private tracking and community discovery use cases

## 2025-08-02: Multi-User Rating Implementation

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Allow multiple users to rate the same book, with aggregated community ratings displayed alongside personal ratings.

### Context

Current system only supports single-user ratings. To enable community discovery, need to support multiple ratings per book while maintaining clear distinction between personal and community ratings.

### Rationale

- Enables community-driven book discovery
- Maintains personal rating integrity
- Allows for rating-based recommendation algorithms
- Supports social features while preserving individual preferences

## 2025-08-02: Testing Strategy

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Pest as the primary testing framework with focus on feature tests covering user workflows and unit tests for business logic.

### Context

Need to establish testing practices that ensure reliability while maintaining development velocity.

### Rationale

- Pest provides excellent Laravel integration and readable test syntax
- Feature tests ensure critical user workflows remain functional
- Unit tests provide confidence in business logic changes
- Automated testing enables safe refactoring and rapid development
