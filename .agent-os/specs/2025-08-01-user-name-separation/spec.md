# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: User Name Field Separation
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Replace the single name field in the User model with separate fields for first name, middle name, last name, and suffix to provide more granular control over user name data. This enhancement will improve data structure, enable better formatting options, and align with common database practices for storing personal names.

## User Stories

### User Registration with Separated Name Fields

As a new user, I want to enter my first and last name separately during registration, with optional middle name and suffix fields, so that my name is properly stored and displayed throughout the application.

During registration, users will see separate input fields for first name (required), middle name (optional), last name (required), and suffix (optional). The form will validate that both first and last names are provided before allowing submission. Upon successful registration, the user's name components will be stored separately in the database.

### User Profile Name Editing

As an existing user, I want to edit my name components individually in my profile settings, so that I can update specific parts of my name without retyping everything.

Users will access their profile settings and see their current name displayed in separate fields. They can modify any field independently while maintaining the requirement that first and last names must not be empty. Changes will be validated and saved to update the user's name information.

## Spec Scope

1. **Database Migration** - Create migration to split existing name field into first_name, middle_name, last_name, and suffix columns
2. **User Model Updates** - Modify User model to use separated name fields with proper validation rules
3. **Registration Form Enhancement** - Update registration form to include separate input fields for name components
4. **Profile Form Updates** - Modify user profile edit form to allow editing of individual name fields
5. **Factory Updates** - Update User factory to generate test data with separated name fields

## Out of Scope

- Internationalization of name formats (e.g., different name ordering for different cultures)
- Name parsing logic for existing data migration (will require manual data cleanup if needed)
- Updates to email templates or other areas where full name is displayed
- API endpoint changes for external consumers

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can successfully register with separated name fields, with first and last name being required
2. Existing users can edit their name components individually through the profile settings
3. All existing tests pass with the new name structure, and new tests validate the separated fields
